    "p3": "The Founder Dragons were the first to master the magic of the five enemy color combinations.\n\t\tWhen the humanoid races arose, at first the dragons were angered that mortals would try to harness\n\t\tthe wild forces of magic, but they came to realize that only through disciplined study would magic\n\t\tbe in safe hands. So, centuries ago, the dragons founded an institution devoted to the study of\n\t\tthe five mana dichotomies, and that institution is what we now know as Strixhaven. The five colleges\n\t\twere based around the magic mastered by each of those dragons. To this day, the Founder Dragons\n\t\troam the plane, the five deadly sages of the skies. They no longer associate directly with Strixhaven,\n\t\tpreferring to let the deans of the college speak in their stead. The dragons' wisdom is vast, but\n\t\ttheir tempers can be short. Mages seek them out only to learn the most elusive of secrets.",
